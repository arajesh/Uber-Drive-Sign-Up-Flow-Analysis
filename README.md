# Uber Driver SignUp Flow Analysis
<br>
Uberâ€™s Driver team is interested in predicting which driver signups are most likely to start driving. <br>
To help explore this question, data is collected with of a cohort of driver signups in January 2016.The data was pulled a few months after they signed up to include the result of whether they actually completed their first trip. It also includes several pieces of background information gather about the driver and their car.

I have used this data set to understand what factors are best at predicting whether a signup will start to drive, and offered suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Uber.
